//6: Errors and Debugging:
// 6.1: Types of Errors: Syntax , Logical, Runtime
//6.2: Syntax Error: -> You know better lol 
//6.3: Runtime Error: -> ex: reference error, type error, Invalid json parse(syntax error), file not found error(fs module) (look notes)
//6.4: Logical Error: (takes time to get the logical error)
// refer notes 
//6.5: Using Debugger and knowing its tools: refer notes for better understanding
// We can run js codes in node js terminal using debug console

//6.6: Debugging with Async Codes: 
// same refer notes for debugging 
// seee how tools work, the debug panel and the debug console, learn how to use breakpoints in debugging especially in async codes 
// Async code me dhyan rakhna hoga ki har call back me debug point lagaye yeh mt sochna yeh toh sip krke chale ja rha debug toh kr hi nhi raha
// In short Async code me har point ke baad mujhe debug points lagana hai

//6.7: Restart Debug with Nodemon: While debugging if we do some changes then nodemon will not be aware coz we start debugging from Run options and not from nodemon, so it is imp to connect nodemon with debugging so that whenever we do some changes while debugging nodemon restarts the server again with new changes
