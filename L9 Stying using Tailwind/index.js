//9: Styling using tailwind CSS:: 

// 9.1: Serving static files: We cannot directly get the css files in the server as it is vulnerable to others.. so we create a new folder named as public and there we create our css or other important files and for making them public we use a middleware of express js to make that path public 

//9.2 Introduction to Tailwind CSS: learn about it from the notes 

//9.3 Utility Classes: Pehle se hi kuch css classes define hota hai ham directly usko use kr lete hai tailwind me
//9.4: Installing Extention - tailwindcss intellisense = it helps me auto-completion of codes
//9.5: Including/Installing Tailwindcss: npm i -D tailwindcss@3 postcss autoprefixer
//                            npx tailwindcss init           --> This is for intialising tailwind css config
// installing tailwind is annoying but  anyways.. we need to create a css file inside views folder and inside that provide 3 css commands..loook for notes there are other things there 
// tailwindcss is nothing just you doing a type of inline css not exactly inline, as tailwind will create an another css file automatic and will will update it as you keep writing the code
